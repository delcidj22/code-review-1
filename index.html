  <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Jonathan, I was born in San Salvador, El Salvador. At 4 years old, my family and I moved to Seattle, WA. 
    Where I have spent the rest of my life in. I grew up playing baseball and cheering on the Mariners. I don't play anymore, but my love for baseball still runs deep, and I'm still a huge Mariners fan hoping for one day to have a world series win.</p>
  <h2>Hobbies and Interests:</h2>
    <p>A big hobby of mine includes gaming, my favorite game at the moment is Apex Legends. Along with gaming, I also enjoy listening to music, some of my favorite artists include:</p>

      <li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
      <li>Mac Miller</li>
      <li>Drake</li>

    </ol>
    <p>I also enjoy spending time with my family, my partner and my dog!</p>
  <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with a BA in American Ethnic Studies</p>
