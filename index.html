    <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>My name is Jonathan, I was born in San Salvador, El Salvador. At 4 years old, my family and I moved to Seattle, WA. 
      Where I have spent the rest of my life in. I grew up playing baseball and cheering on the Mariners. I don't play anymore, but my love for baseball still runs deep, and I'm still a huge Mariners fan hoping for one day to have a world series win. I also enjoy spending time with my family, my partner and my dog!</p>

    <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with a BA in American Ethnic Studies. Since graduating college I have worked in many roles all within education. Working with the YMCA, Boys & Girls Club and now Treehouse have been great experiences. 
        Since the beginning of COVID I have been very interested in learning new skills, which includes coding and computers. My main goal now is to learn as much as possible. <em>I hope to one day earn a tech job working either in the sports, music or gaming industry.</em></p>
